# bakery_ordering_system
This is a web application I am working on that provides a way for users to place custom orders on the web for a bakery I have worked at for a long time. **work in progress** - currently my main project at the moment. 

I am publicly posting this because the source code for this web application does not directly link back to the bakery it is designed to be used by. In the future if there are any such details I will omit them from this code, but any source code publicly posted is not a security risk for the establishment, rather a project I am working on in my free time.

Online ordering is becomming increasingly popular and necessary, and currently the business uses an email and rough wordpress form system to intake online orders, but it is not very customizable in terms of blocking off dates, times, and days they are already booked for. The purpose of this web app is to hopefully provide a more customizable solution to the business's online ordering system and to solve these logistical issues.
